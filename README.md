### Disclaimer
* This is more of a personal list and doesn't have *every* posting. Sorry.
* Mainly focused on USA.
* I won't post links unless hard to find.
* I'm trying to be as accurate as possible for 2022 postings (no random junior positions or 2021 postings unless specified in the description)
* New postings added to top
* Postings separated into `Postings I applied to` and `Postings I didn't apply to`

### FAQ
#### How to apply to jobs faster (greenhouse, workday, lever)
* Use [Kumquat Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kumquat/mkjkimankkfhefaabddppkhbobffaadp?hl=en-US)
#### Is this repo up to date?
* I will try to update it once a day with companies that open up their new grad applications
#### Where do I search for job postings?
* LinkedIn search bar with `software grad` and `Past 24 hours` filters
* Some companies post on Indeed/Canvas only
* Small companies that pay well may have postings on Angel
